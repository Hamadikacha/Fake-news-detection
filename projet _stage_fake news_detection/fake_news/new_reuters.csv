"Burry, famous for 'Big Short,' bought bearish options against S&P, Nasdaq 100","A man uses an umbrella to guard against snowfall as he walks past the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square, Midtown New York March 20, 2015. REUTERS/Adrees Latif

NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Michael Burry, the money manager made famous in the book and film ""The Big Short,"" held bearish options against the broad S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 Index at the end of the second quarter, according to securities fillings released on Monday.

Burry's Scion Asset Management bought put options with a notional value of $739 million against the popular Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ.O) during the quarter, and separate put options with a notional value of $886 million against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY.P).

Put options convey the right to sell shares at a fixed price in the future and are typically bought to express a bearish or defensive view.

It was not clear what the fund paid to buy the puts - an amount that could be a small fraction of their notional value - or the contracts' present value, given that regulatory filings do not require the disclosure of options strikes, purchase prices and expiration dates.

Since the filings disclose only long positions it was also not clear whether the puts were held outright or as part of a larger trade involving other contracts that might have been sold short.

Burry rose to fame with his bets against the U.S. housing market before the 2008 financial crisis. Michael Lewis' nonfiction book ""The Big Short"" was released in 2010 and the movie version came out in 2015.

The S&P 500 (.SPX) is up roughly 17% for the year to date while the Nasdaq 100 (.IXIC) is up nearly 39% over the same period. Outsized gains in a handful of megacap companies such as Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Meta Platforms (META.O) have fueled much of the year's rally.

The filing also showed that the fund liquidated its stakes in Chinese e-commerce company JD.com (9618.HK) and Alibaba Group Holdings (9988.HK), as well as regional banks including PacWest (PACW.O) and Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL.N) that it had bet on in the first quarter.

The firm noted it had sold its 150,000 shares of First Republic Bank (FRCB.PK) as well, but did not indicate whether that came before the company's May 1 collapse.

Among its long positions, the fund more than doubled its stake in online luxury goods market RealReal Inc (REAL.O), which is up nearly 100% for the year to date, and added new stakes in iHeartMedia (IHRT.O), HanesBrands (HBI.N), and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD.O), among others, the filing showed.

Shares of iHeartMedia and HanesBrands are each down 16% or more for the year to date, while shares of Warner Brothers Discovery are up nearly 43%.

The firm also added 10,000 shares of the iShares MSCI Japan ETF, which is up 13.5% for the year to date.

Scion Asset Management did not respond to a request for comment. Its positions were reported in quarterly filings known as 13-fs, which show its holdings at the end of the most recent quarter and may not reflect current positions. While backward- looking, these filings are one of the few ways that investors can see the positions of institutional investors such as hedge funds.

Burry, who frequently turns over his portfolio, drew wide attention last August when he dumped all of his long positions and bought a stake in prison company Geo Group Inc (GEO.N). He no longer owns shares of the company.

Summary

Companies Russian central bank hikes rates by 350 bp to 12%

Bank holds extraordinary meeting after Kremlin rebuke

Rouble had plunged past 100 vs dollar on Monday

Inflationary pressure is building, says central bank

MOSCOW, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Russia's central bank hiked its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 12% on Tuesday, an emergency move to try and halt the rouble's recent slide after a public call from the Kremlin for tighter monetary policy.

The extraordinary rate meeting came after the rouble plummeted past the 100 threshold against the dollar on Monday, dragged down by the impact of Western sanctions on Russia's balance of trade and as military spending soars.

The rouble pared gains after the decision to stand 0.3% weaker at 98.00 by 0948 GMT, but still significantly above lows near 102 on Monday which had not been hit since the early weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine.

President Vladimir Putin's economic adviser Maxim Oreshkin on Monday rebuked the central bank, blaming what he called its soft monetary policy for weakening the rouble.

Hours after Oreshkin's words, the bank announced the emergency meeting, throwing the currency a lifeline.

""Inflationary pressure is building up,"" the bank said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The decision is aimed at limiting price stability risks.

""The pass-through of the rouble's depreciation to prices is gaining momentum and inflation expectations are on the rise.""

Though stopping the rot, analysts largely agreed that the move would not have a long-lasting impact.

""As long as the war continues it just gets worse for Russia, the Russian economy and the rouble,"" said Timothy Ash, senior EM sovereign strategist at Bluebay Asset Management.

""Hiking policy rates won’t solve anything - they might temporarily slow the pace of depreciation of the rouble at the price of slower real GDP growth - unless the core problem, the war and sanctions are resolved.""

Promsvyazbank analysts said an additional hike may be required if the rouble does not stabilise and that measures to reduce the rouble liquidity surplus were also needed.

ECONOMICS OR POLITICS?

Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has won plaudits for her handling of the economy since Russia began what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, but the plunging rouble and high inflation have put her on the back foot, especially among pro-war nationalists.

The Kremlin's public criticism of her monetary policy adds further pressure as Russia heads towards a presidential election in March 2024, with consumers battling rising prices for basic goods.

""While such a depreciation risks boosting inflation, it is also the signal it sends out to the Russian public about the costs of the invasion of Ukraine,"" said Stuart Cole, chief macro economist at Equiti Capital in London.

""As such, today's decision will likely have had an element of politics behind it as well as economics.""

INFLATION PRESSURE

The bank last made an emergency rate hike in late February 2022 with a rate raise to 20% in the immediate fallout of Russia's despatching troops to Ukraine. The bank then steadily lowered the cost of borrowing to 7.5% as strong inflation pressure eased in the second half of 2022.

Since its last cut in September 2022, the bank had held rates but steadily increased its hawkish rhetoric, eventually hiking by 100 basis points to 8.5% at its last scheduled meeting in July. The next rate decision is due on Sept. 15.

Russia saw double-digit inflation in 2022 and after a deceleration in the spring of 2023 due to that high base effect, annual inflation is now above the central bank's 4% target once more and quickening.

In annualised terms on a seasonally adjusted basis, current price growth over the last three months amounted to 7.6% on average, the bank said.

'SLOW THE BLEEDING'

Russia's widening budget deficit and stark labour shortage have contributed to rising inflationary pressure this year, but the rouble's rapid slide from around 70 against the dollar at the start of the year to more than 100 on Monday has pushed the central bank to act.

The bank, which blames the rouble's slide on Russia's shrinking current account surplus - down 85% year-on-year in January-July - has already tried to limit the rouble's decline.

Last week, it halted the finance ministry's FX purchases to try to reduce volatility, a step that effectively saw Russia abandon its budget rule. Analysts widely agreed that those measures alone were too minimal in scope to significantly support the currency.

""Today's rate hike will only temporarily slow the bleeding,"" said Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London.

""Russia will struggle to attract capital inflows because of sanctions,"" he said. ""And there's little ammunition for FX intervention – the central bank has some unfrozen renminbi assets and gold reserves, but the bar for using these is likely to be high.""

China suspends youth jobless data after record high readings,"Construction workers take a nap in front of a wall of a construction site during their lunch break in Beijing, China, May 5, 2015. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon /File Photo

Aug 15 (Reuters) - China suspended publication of its youth jobless data on Tuesday, saying it needed to review the methodology behind the closely watched benchmark, which has hit record highs in one of many warning signs for the world's second-largest economy.

The decision announced shortly after the release of weaker-than-expected factory and retail sales data sparked rare backlash on social media amid growing frustration about employment prospects in the country.

It also marks the latest move by Chinese authorities to restrict access to key data and information, a trend that is unnerving overseas investors.

Fu Linghui, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said the release of data would be suspended while authorities look to ""optimise"" collection methods.

""In recent years, the number of university students has continued to expand,"" Fu said. ""The main responsibility of current students is studying. Society has different views on whether students looking for jobs before graduation should be included in labour force surveys and statistics.""

This issue, as well as the definition of the age range currently set at 16-24, ""needs further research,"" Fu said.

In recent months, China has restricted foreign users' access to some corporate registries and academic journals, and cracked down on due diligence firms operating in the country, a vital source of information on China for overseas businesses.

""The declining availability of macro data may further weaken global investors' confidence in China,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, adding that youth unemployment was expected to have risen in July.

At the height of its COVID-19 outbreak late last year, China abruptly changed the way it classified deaths from the disease, a move that fueled criticism abroad and at home.

Tuesday's move has also been met with scepticism at home as young Chinese face their toughest summer job-hunting season.

The most recent NBS data on youth unemployment, published last month, showed the jobless rate jumping to a record high of 21.3% in June.

Some 47% of graduates returned home within six months of graduation in 2022, up from 43% in 2018, state-run China News Service reported last week, citing a private-sector survey.

""If you close your eyes then it doesn't exist,"" one user wrote on microblogging site Weibo, where a hashtag related to NBS' decision received over 10 million views.

""There is a saying called 'burying your head in the sand',"" wrote another user.

Tesla launches cheaper Model S and X versions in US with shorter ranges,"The logo of car manufacturer Tesla is seen at a branch office in Bern, Switzerland October 28, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo

Companies Tesla Inc Follow

Aug 14 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) has introduced two cheaper versions of its Model S sedan and Model X SUV in the U.S. with shorter driving ranges, the automaker's website showed on Monday, continuing its focus on driving down costs to prioritize sales growth.

The new S and X ""standard range"" models are priced at $78,490 and $88,490, respectively - about 10% lower than the previous lowest-priced models - and are available for delivery between September and October 2023, the website showed.

The lowest price is for cars with a ""pearly white"" exterior and an all-black interior, with other colors costing extra.

The new Model S has a driving range of up to 320 miles (515 km), lower than the basic and performance, plaid versions that offer up to 405 miles and 396 miles, respectively.

The new Model X SUV has range of up to 269 miles, well below its basic and performance, plaid versions that offer up to 348 miles and 333 miles, respectively.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new versions of the models.

The Austin, Texas-based automaker has slashed prices in the U.S., China and other markets since late last year, and has offered other incentives to reduce inventory, trying to shield itself against competition and economic uncertainty.

The company on Monday cut prices in China for its Model Y long-range and performance versions, sending shares lower on concerns of further pressure on its profit margins.

The latest moves come as the carmaker readies the first deliveries of its delayed Cybertruck and works to complete a plant in Mexico dedicated to a mass-market EV that will be the basis for a robotaxi.

Tesla's S and X models are the company's oldest offerings, introduced in 2012 and priced at a premium compared to the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover vehicles.

The company delivered 19,225 Model X and S vehicles in the second quarter of this year, up from 16,162 vehicles last year.

China cuts key rates as weak batch of July data darkens economic outlook,"Summary

Companies China's industrial output, retail sales growth slows

July data adds to recent raft of weak indicators, point to sluggish recovery

Central bank cuts rates to bolster growth

Property investment extends fall for 17th consecutive month

Some analysts warn of downward economic spiral if support not ramped up

BEIJING, Aug 15 (Reuters) - A broad array of Chinese data on Tuesday highlighted intensifying pressure on the economy from multiple fronts, prompting Beijing to cut key policy rates to shore up activity but analysts say more support is needed to revitalise growth.

Just before the release of a batch of July data, China's central bank unexpectedly chopped one set of key interest rates, and followed it with cuts on other rates hours later, underlining the rapid loss of the post-COVID economic rebound that has shaken global financial markets.

Tuesday's data released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), which comes on top of a raft of weak indicators from last week, showed retail sales, industrial output and investment all growing at a slower than expected pace - indicating the engines of business and consumption in the world's second-biggest economy were severely underpowered.

Additionally, China suspended publishing youth jobless data, which hit a record high of 21.3% in June.

""All the main activity indicators undershot consensus expectations in July, with most either stagnant or barely expanding in month on month terms,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, economist at Capital Economics.

""And with financial troubles at developers such as Country Garden likely to weigh on the housing market in the near-term, there is a real risk of the economy slipping into a recession unless policy support is ramped up soon.""

Nomura analysts were equally downbeat on China's economic outlook.

""We believe the Chinese economy is faced with an imminent downward spiral with the worst yet to come, and the rate cut this morning will be of limited help,"" they said.

Most economists see downside risk to Chinese growth but they do not expect a recession.

Industrial output grew 3.7% from a year earlier, slowing from the 4.4% pace seen in June, the NBS data showed, and was below expectations for a 4.4% increase in a Reuters poll of analysts.

Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 2.5%, down from a 3.1% increase in June and missed analysts' forecasts of 4.5% growth despite the summer travel season.

It was the slowest growth since December 2022, showing how much of a challenge authorities face as they try to make consumption the key driver of future economic growth.

MORE STIMULUS

Asian stocks stalled at one-month lows, the yuan hit a 9-month nadir while the dollar held broadly firm after the weak Chinese data and latest policy easing measures.

Following the first rate cuts, China's major state-owned banks were seen selling U.S. dollars and buying yuan in a bid to stem rapid declines in the currency, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Sovereign bond yields fell to three-year lows, and benchmark stock indexes were down.

Record-low credit growth and rising deflation risks in July necessitated more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some housing developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also soured market confidence.

Nie Wen, an economist at Hwabao Trust, expects special bonds to be introduced urgently and said the probability of a reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in the short run is relatively large.

Policymakers last month released a batch of stimulus measures, from boosting auto and home appliances consumption, relaxing some property restrictions to pledging support to the private sector, as a post-COVID rebound rapidly lost steam since the second quarter.

The catering sector, which reaped benefits from the COVID reopening, saw slower revenue growth in July from June. Investment in the private sector shrank 0.5% in the first seven months, extending 0.2% decline in the first half of 2023.

STRUCTURAL PAINS

The persistent drag in the property sector, mounting local government debt pressure, high youth jobless rate and cooling foreign demand continue to be major impediments to fostering a sustainable economic revival.

China is undergoing a painful transition to a less debt-fuelled, less property-centric and more consumer-driven economy, said Robert Carnell, Asia-Pacific head of research at ING.

""We will continue to see weak macro data for the foreseeable future. It is a necessary part of the adjustment and is far preferable to resurrecting the debt-fuelled property model that propelled growth previously. But we do need to lower our expectations for China's growth.""

Other data on Tuesday showed fixed asset investment expanded 3.4% in the first seven months of 2023 from the same period a year earlier, versus expectations for a 3.8% rise. It grew 3.8% in the January-June period.

Investment in the property sector tumbled 8.5% year-on-year in January-July, after shrinking 7.9% in January-June, extending its fall for the 17th consecutive month.

The nationwide survey-based jobless rate climbed slightly to 5.3% from 5.2% in June. Among OECD members, the average unemployment rate was 4.8%, with youth joblessness around 10%.

China set its 2023 growth target at around 5%, but Nomura analysts warn the country could miss the goal again as it did last year.

""We also see bigger downside risk to our 4.9% y-o-y growth forecast for both Q3 and Q4, and it is increasingly possible that annual GDP growth this year will miss the 5.0% mark.""

"UK basic wage growth hits record, adding to Bank of England's worries","Summary

Companies Basic wage growth +7.8% vs Reuters poll +7.4%

Total wages also up by more than expected at +8.2%

Some signs of cooling in jobs market too

Jobless rate rises to 4.2% from 4.0%

Sterling gains, investors add to bets on more rate hikes

LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Basic wages in Britain hit a new record growth rate, figures showed on Tuesday, adding to worries for the Bank of England (BoE) about long-term inflation pressures even after 14 back-to-back increases in interest rates.

Official data showed some fresh signs of cooling in the jobs market with the unemployment rate unexpectedly rising to 4.2% from 4.0%, the highest since the three months to October 2021 and climbing more quickly than the BoE has forecast.

But the 7.8% increase in basic earnings - the strongest in records data back to 2001 - represented further impetus for Britain's high rate of inflation with many employers resorting to increased pay offers to retain or attract staff.

Annual pay growth including bonuses also accelerated, hitting 8.2%, the fastest outside the coronavirus pandemic period when government job subsidies distorted the data.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected smaller increases in both measures of pay.

Sterling rose against the dollar and euro after Tuesday's data. Two-year British government bond yields, which are sensitive to speculation about BoE rate changes, hit their highest level in a month.

Samuel Tombs, an economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said wage increases were set to slow in the second half of 2023.

""It usually takes time for changes in labour market tightness to feed through to wage growth, and several survey indicators now point to slowing wage increases,"" he said, adding he expected the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would hike rates one more time to 5.5%.

""The momentum in wage growth still is too strong for the Committee to take a break just yet,"" Tombs said.

Pay growth looks set to overtake the rate of consumer price inflation which is forecast to have slowed to 6.8% in July in data due to be released by the ONS on Wednesday.

Markets saw a roughly 55% chance of the BoE's benchmark rates hitting 6% in early 2024, up from their current level of 5.25%. On Monday, the chance of rates going that high stood at about one in three.

""MATERIALLY ABOVE""

Governor Andrew Bailey said earlier this month that the rate of pay growth was ""materially above"" the central bank's forecasts but the BoE also signalled it was getting close to pausing its run of interest rate increases.

Bailey and his colleagues may take comfort from some signals of a cooling in the labour market beyond the data on pay.

As well the surprise rise in the unemployment rate, the number of people in employment fell by 66,000 and job vacancies extended their run of falls to their lowest since mid-2021, also dropping by 66,000 on the quarter to 1.02 million.

Experimental payroll data from the tax office - which is more timely than the ONS data but prone to big revisions - pointed to a sharp pull-back in pay growth in July.

However, inactivity due to long-term sickness rose to a new record high, adding to the problems for employers seeking to fill job vacancies and adding to the pressure on pay growth.

The inactivity rate - which measures people out of work and not looking for it, and which the BoE hopes to see fall - edged up slightly, the first increase in roughly a year.

Public sector pay growth surged to a new record high, up by an annual 9.6% in the three months to June including bonuses, following a series of industrial actions that resulted in improved pay settlements for some groups of workers.

""Make no mistake, the battle to push up pay has been hard fought and it's certainly far from over,"" Sharon Graham, secretary general of Unite the Union, said.

China central bank unexpectedly cuts rates to support sputtering economy,"Paramilitary police officers stand guard in front of the headquarters of the People's Bank of China, the central bank (PBOC), in Beijing, China September 30, 2022. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo

SHANGHAI/SINGAPORE, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China's central bank unexpectedly cut key policy rates for the second time in three months on Tuesday, in a fresh sign that the authorities are ramping up monetary easing efforts to boost a sputtering economic recovery.

Analysts said the move opened the door to a potential cut in China's lending benchmark loan prime rate (LPR) next week.

Tumbling credit growth and rising deflation risks in July necessitated more monetary easing measures to arrest the slowdown, market watchers said, while default risks at some housing developers and missed payments by a private wealth manager also affected financial market confidence.

""All of these add to the urgency that policymakers need to act fast before consumer and business confidence deteriorate sharply,"" said Tommy Wu, senior China economist at Commerzbank.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said it lowered the rate on 401 billion yuan ($55.25 billion) worth of one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans to some financial institutions by 15 basis points to 2.50% from 2.65% previously.

The cash injection was to counteract factors including tax payments in order to ""keep banking system liquidity reasonably ample"", the PBOC said in an online statement.

In a Reuters poll of 26 market watchers conducted this week, 20 participants, or 77%, predicted that the central bank would leave the MLF rate unchanged. Only six respondents forecast a marginal rate reduction.

""The surprising rate cut was a prompt response to support subdued credit data and China recovery (that) may unleash yuan depreciation pressure towards 7.3,"" said Ken Cheung, chief Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank.

""In particularly, the PBOC may intend to support the medium-term credit conditions via the asymmetric cut, and opened the way for a cut to LPR, especially the 5-year LPR, to support the struggling property sector.""

The MLF rate serves as a guide to the LPR and markets mostly use the medium-term policy rate as a precursor to any changes to the lending benchmarks. The monthly fixing of the LPR is due next Monday.

The central bank also injected 204 billion yuan through seven-day reverse repos while cutting borrowing costs by 10 basis points to 1.80% from 1.90% previously, it said in an online statement.

China remains an outlier among global central banks as it has loosened monetary policy to shore up a stalling recovery whereas others have been in tightening cycles as they battle high inflation.

Tuesday's rate move has widened the yield gap with other major economies, particularly the United States, putting more pressure on the yuan and risking outflows.

China's yuan has lost about 5% against the dollar so far this year to become one of the worst performing Asian currencies. The yuan traded at 7.2842 per dollar as of 0145 GMT, compared with the previous close of 7.2580.

Yields on China's 10-year government bonds eased to 2.56%, the lowest level since May 2020.

The PBOC lowered key policy rates in June to prop up the broad economy, but data has been increasingly weak since.

Binance files for protective order against SEC,"Binance logo is seen in this illustration taken March 31, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo

Aug 15 (Reuters) - Crypto exchange Binance late on Monday filed for a protective court order against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission saying the regulator's requests for information were ""over broad"" and ""unduly burdensome"".

In a court filing in the US District Court of Columbia, BAM Trading, Binance U.S.'s operating company and BAM Management said the group had already provided sufficient information to the regulator.

The protective order seeks to limit the SEC, among other things, to four depositions from BAM employees, and to drop the deposition of BAM's chief executive and of its chief financial officer, without naming anyone.

Binance and the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In June, U.S. regulators sued Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao for allegedly operating a ""web of deception,"" listing 13 charges including claims that the company artificially inflated its trading volumes, diverted customer funds, failed to restrict U.S. customers from its platform and misled investors about its market surveillance controls.

""...the SEC has still yet to identify any evidence suggesting that customer assets were misused or dissipated in any way,"" the filing said.

The SEC has declined BAM's proposals to meaningfully limit its requests and is opposed to the motion for a protective order, the filing said.

Japan's policymakers hold fire as yen enters intervention range,"Banknotes of Japanese yen are seen in this illustration picture taken September 23, 2022. REUTERS/Florence Lo/Illustration

TOKYO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - As the yen slid past 145 per dollar with barely a murmur from Japanese policymakers during recent days, suspicion grew that they won't be as quick to order intervention as they were last year as they now reap some benefits from a weaker currency.

Surging exports helped economic growth hit 6% on an annualised basis in the second quarter, and lower global oil prices have helped keep a lid on the import bill.

But a key factor behind the yen's weakness is unchanged, namely the yawning yield gap with the United States. The Bank of Japan is taking baby steps away from its ultra-loose monetary policy, and there are increasing hopes that U.S. rates may have peaked, but as of now, the bond market provides a good reason to sell yen.

Yet currency traders remain nervous about provoking intervention, as the yen entered the same zone that triggered heavy dollar selling by Japanese authorities in September and October of last year.

Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki issued a reminder on Tuesday against causing volatility in the exchange rate, as the

yen struck a 9/1-2 month low of 145.60 in Asian trading.

Suzuki warned that rapid moves are ""undesirable"" and the government is ""ready to respond appropriately,"" while reiterating that no specific levels are targeted for intervention.

Officials had been a lot more vociferous in June when the yen weakened past 144, and their subdued response to the latest depreciation was interpreted by market participants as a sign that Tokyo will tolerate a bit more weakness so long as speculators didn't push it too fast.

""The pain associated with the 145-150 level is less now for the economy, so I don't think they'll be quite as aggressive as they were last year,"" said Aaron Hurd, a senior portfolio manager at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.

If the uptrend for the dollar-yen rate is gradual, intervention isn't likely until ""around 150 or a little bit above,"" he said.

For now, traders are testing the waters by selling the yen against sterling and the Swiss franc, mindful that selling against the dollar could gather momentum quickly.

NO IMPERATIVE TILL 150

Japan spent more than 9 trillion yen ($62 billion) intervening in currency markets last year to arrest the yen's decline, buying yen in September and October - first at levels around 145 and again at a 32-year low just short of 152.

At the end of August last year, the price of Brent crude oil was about $105 per barrel, and complaints about the pain from imported energy prices were in the Japanese press on a daily basis.

""Not only economically, but also politically, yen weakness at that time was a problem, and it clearly impacted the government's approval rating,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management in Tokyo.

The price of Brent is now around $88, and those complaints over imported fuel have faded into memory.

From a purely macroeconomic perspective, Kichikawa said, officials have no imperative to prevent yen weakness before 150, which is consistent with the mild inflationary pressure that the BOJ aims to foster.

The bond market, which precipitated the yen's slide, may ultimately give Japan's authorities reason to hold off on pressing the intervention button.

Should the lynchpin 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stabilise not far above 4%, and Japanese yields rise towards the BOJ's new 1% cap, Japanese authorities may be inclined to let market forces perform a gradual recovery in the yen as the yield gap closes.

""The policy divergence story is going to turn, if it hasn't already,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, a currency strategist at Barclays in Tokyo. ""The risk of intervention definitely increases above 145, but the urgency is less.""

"Heeding Beijing's call, law firms tone down China risks in IPO applications","A Chinese national flag flutters outside the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) building on the Financial Street in Beijing, China July 9, 2021. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang/File Photo

HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Law firms in China are scrambling to comply with Beijing's new guidance to tone down the language used to describe China-related business risks in companies' offshore listing documents, five people familiar with the matter said.

The moves come after China's securities regulator last month in a closed-door meeting asked domestic law firms to refrain from including negative descriptions of China's policies or its business and legal environment in the IPO prospectuses.

A failure to do so could mean their listings are not able to get a regulatory nod, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) warned, Reuters had first reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

The law firms are now racing to change the wordings in some already submitted listing prospectuses and applications yet to be filed, said the five sources, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the matter.

Some potential issuers, which have yet to be given the green light from the CSRC, were earlier this month asked by the regulator to tweak the risk factors in their prospectuses to comply with the new offshore listing rules, said one of the sources.

China's new listing rules, which came into effect in March, stipulate that any ""distortion or misinterpretation"" on China's laws and policy, business environment, and judiciary was prohibited.

All major markets require listing aspirants to disclose to prospective investors risks related to the companies themselves, their business sectors, and the countries where they are headquartered in their offering prospectuses.

Beijing's demand for companies to tone down China business-related risks comes amid the country's stuttering economy, heightened geopolitical tensions and the government's sharpened focus on national security.

As part of the changes demanded by the regulator, lawyers are replacing descriptions of ""COVID lockdown measures"" in IPO applications with ""the COVID-19 pandemic"" to avoid references to harsh and controversial travel and business curbs during the pandemic, said the second source.

Also, instead of mentioning ""foreign exchange control"" in some IPO applications, local lawyers in China are proposing to use more neutral phrasing such as ""foreign exchange management"", the source added.

Prospective Chinese equity issuers in offshore markets, including the United States, are required to file to the CSRC days after they submit listing applications offshore and need China's green light to proceed with their fundraisings.

Some of the offshore IPO prospectuses, in which the changes on China risk disclosures are being made, are yet to be filed with the CSRC, the sources said.

The CSRC did not respond to Reuters' faxed request for comment.

RISK DISCLOSURES

Since the CSRC's meeting with law firms late last month, at least two IPO applications have tweaked the ways they describe how China makes policy changes, said the first source and a third person.

Those documents now say Chinese policies and regulations can be amended or adjusted from time to time, the two sources said, a marked shift in tone from previous wording that said the government and other local authorities can order rule changes randomly or without prior notice.

Other changes include removing a statement that entails the enforcement of arbitral awards in China is difficult, the first source said, adding, lawyers have instead put a description that China's judicial system is different from other jurisdictions.

For one prospective Hong Kong listing, lawyers have removed references to uncertainties around China's regulatory, political and economic environments and foreign exchange control in the prospectus, according to a fourth source.

In revised listing application rules that came into effect on Aug 1, Hong Kong's bourse removed a section on China risks previously required specifically for mainland-incorporated companies, a move it said would align disclosure rules for all IPO-aspirants.

In response to Reuters' request for comment, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange said on Tuesday that all listing applicants from all jurisdictions are required under Hong Kong's listing rules to disclose all material risks, including jurisdictional risks.

""There has been no change to this requirement.""

Four of the sources said the toning down on China business-related risks in the domestic companies' offshore listing applications could trigger queries from the U.S. regulator, which has warned companies of insufficient China-risk disclosures.

"Sterling rises on wage growth, yuan hits 9-month low after surprise China rate cut","[1/2] Chinese Yuan and U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in this illustration taken March 10, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

Companies Bank Of England Follow

LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Sterling rose on Tuesday after data showed British basic wages grew at a record pace, adding to the Bank of England's inflation worries, while the yuan sank to a nine-month trough after China's central bank unexpectedly cut key policy rates for a second time in three months.

In contrast, the Russian rouble initially firmed after Russia's central bank lifted its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 12% at an emergency meeting to try and halt the currency's weakening past 100 to the dollar after a public call from the Kremlin for tighter monetary policy.

The pound was last 0.12% higher at $1.2700, after rising as much as 0.28% to $1.2720 following data showing British wages excluding bonuses were 7.8% higher than a year earlier in the three months to June.

That represented the highest annual growth rate since comparable records began in 2001.

The UK unemployment rate, however, unexpectedly rose to 4.2% from 4.0% with analysts flagging rising wages and unemployment would make it harder for the BoE to decide on future interest rate increases after 14 back-to-back rate hikes.

""This morning’s numbers have not just given the central bank a headache, but a migraine,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.

CHINESE SURPRISE

Elsewhere, the yuan weakened 0.4% to 7.3079 after falling as far as 7.3125 per dollar for the first time since Nov. 4 in offshore trading as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) cut its rates in an effort to boost a sputtering economic recovery.

The yuan briefly bounced back as major state-owned banks were seen selling dollars to support the local currency.

The dollar index , which measures the currency against six peers including euro and sterling, edged 0.06% lower by 103.11 after hitting a 1-1/2-month high at 103.46 on Monday, buoyed by demand for the safest assets following a spate of disappointing Chinese economic indicators that raised concerns about global growth.

Punctuating those worries, Chinese data on industrial output, retail sales and investment released shortly after the PBOC's rate cut showed unexpected slowdowns.

""We're fast approaching a phase where bets will be on for another round of stimulus"" in China, said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at City Index.

Yield differentials point to a possible break of last year's low of 7.3746 yuan per dollar, ""but headlines that China's state banks have been supporting the yuan should serve as a reminder that Beijing will decide if or when that happens,"" he said.

Against the yen, the U.S. dollar pushed to a fresh nine-month high of 145.85.

Traders are looking for any hints of intervention, after the dollar's surge above 145 last autumn triggered the first yen buying by Japanese officials in a generation.

""We could definitely see more verbal interventions, but unless the move is driven by speculators and the yen is out of sync with other currencies, maybe there's still some way to go before the actual intervention comes,"" said Shinichiro Kadota, a currency strategist at Barclays.

""In any case, I think concerns about intervention is definitely putting a lid on the dollar-yen around these levels.""

Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday that authorities are not targeting absolute currency levels when it comes to intervening in the market.

The Russian rouble, which has recently been dragged down by the impact of Western sanctions on Russia's balance of trade and as military spending soars, was volatile after the central bank rate hike, initially strengthening but then starting to weaken, moving past 97 to the dollar.

LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) has invested in a start-up company developing technology seeking to use vapour from heavy industry to sharply reduce the production costs of zero-carbon hydrogen.

BP Ventures, the British energy giant's venture capital arm, was among several investors in a $12.5 million Series A financing in U.S.-based Advanced Ionics, the companies said on Tuesday.

Other investors include Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T), Clean Energy Ventures and Gatemore Capital Management.

Green hydrogen, produced by splitting water through electrolysis using renewable energy, is expected to play a key role in decarbonising transport and industries.

But it is produced today on a very small scale and costs up to five times more than the most common hydrogen produced from natural gas, which is highly carbon-intensive.

The investment will allow Advanced Ionics to accelerate the small-scale deployment of its water vapour-based electrolysers for heavy industry.

The technology, Symbion, uses heat emitted from a plant's existing operations to drive the electricity use to less than 35 kilowatt hours (kWh) per kilogram of hydrogen compared with more than 50 kWh per kilogram for a typical electrolyser, according to Advanced Ionics.

It sharply reduces the cost of electricity for the electrolysis process, which accounts for more than 70% of green hydrogen production costs, the company said.

The lower electricity consumption will drive the cost of green hydrogen to less than $1 per kilogram, which is less than most fossil-fuel based production, it said.

Advanced Ionics is already running a pilot programme with Spanish oil and gas company Repsol (REP.MC).

BP, which aims to sharply reduce its carbon emissions in the coming decades, is betting big on green hydrogen. By 2030, it aims to produce between 0.5 and 0.7 million tonnes per year of primarily green hydrogen.

Japan's Q2 GDP beats forecasts as exports zoom,"FILE PHOTO-A cargo ship and containers are seen at an industrial port in Tokyo, Japan, February 15, 2022. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo

Summary April-June GDP growth at +6.0% annualised, +1.5% q/q

Exports drive Q2 growth, consumption falls

Solid GDP good news for policymakers

TOKYO, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Japan's economy grew much faster than expected in April-June, as brisk auto exports and tourist arrivals helped offset the drag from a slowing post-COVID consumer recovery, although global recession prospects cloud the outlook.

The 6.0% annualised growth in Japan's economy translated into a quarterly gain of 1.5%, much bigger than median estimates of 0.8% in a Reuters poll and bringing gross domestic product (GDP) to a record high.

It was the fastest expansion since the final quarter of 2020 and followed a revised 3.7% expansion in January-March.

While the headline GDP data provides some relief to policymakers seeking to balance economic growth with sustainable inflation, it masks underlying weakness in the household sector.

Japan’s Q2 GDP grows fastest in more than two years

Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics, said the export-driven momentum in growth is unlikely to be sustained.

""And while capital goods exports bounced back in June as the largest falls in overseas investment are now behind us, we do not expect a vigorous recovery,"" Thieliant said.

Private consumption, which makes up more than half of the economy, fell 0.5% quarter-on-quarter in the April-June period, as price hikes hit sales of food and household appliances.

Exports expanded 3.2% in the second quarter led by car exports and inbound tourism, while capital expenditure was flat.

Japanese automakers have benefited from a weaker yen, which has helped prop up profits amid declining sales in China and an increasingly tough shift to electric vehicles.

Strong U.S. and European demand has also supported exports while the post-COVID boom in foreign tourists has given the economy a much-needed tailwind.

That boost in external demand, or net exports, added 1.8 percentage points to second quarter growth. However, that net contribution was also flattered by a decline in imports for a third straight quarter, which have struggled due to yen weakness.

Meanwhile, domestic demand shaved 0.3 of a percentage point off growth.

""The biggest factor was a decline in imports that pushed up GDP. It doesn't mean a strong recovery in Japanese economy,"" said Takumi Tsunoda, senior economist at Shinkin Central Bank Research Institute.

""As such, the central bank will maintain the current monetary policy and adopt wait-and-see stance for the time being.""

Real wages turned positive for the first time in seven quarters and corporate appetite for investment was solid, Economy Minister Shigeyuki Goto said.

""Against this backdrop, we expect moderate economic recovery to continue although caution is needed on downside risks from global economy and effects of price hikes,"" Goto said.

The Bank of Japan took steps last month to allow long-term interest rates to rise more, a move seen by analysts as the beginning of a gradual shift away from massive monetary stimulus.

"Global stocks stuck near 5-week lows, China cuts rates","[1/2] The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, July 5, 2023. REUTERS/Staff/File Photo

LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Global stocks were stuck near five-week lows on Tuesday as rising government bond yields unnerved investors, while rate cuts from China and disappointing data underscored the economic malaise gripping the world's second biggest economy.

Emerging markets remained in focus a day after Argentina devalued its currency by nearly 18%, while Russia's central bank on Tuesday raised interest rates by 350 basis points at an extraordinary meeting following a fresh slide in the rouble.

U.S. 10-year Treasury yields meanwhile rose to a nine-month high at around 4.22% , while Germany's benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to its highest since March as a selloff in bonds, driven in part by resilient U.S. economic growth, deepened.

European stocks fell almost 0.8% (.STOXX), U.S. stock futures pointed to a weak open on Wall Street , while Asian shares fell 0.4% (.MIAPJ0000PUS).

This all left MSCI's world equity index (.MIWD00000PUS), heading back towards five-week lows touched on Monday.

""We have seen resilient markets but the rise in bond yields and how that gets resolved will be important in the second half of the year,"" said Tim Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy at State Street Global Advisors.

CHINA CUTS, RUSSIA HIKES

Cuts to China's one-year loans to financial institutions, at 15 basis points, were the largest since the outset of the COVID pandemic. Industrial output and retail sales growth both slowed from a month earlier to a year-on-year pace of 3.7% and 2.5% respectively, missing expectations.

The yuan dropped to its lowest in 9-1/2 months, and sources told Reuters that China's major state-owned banks stepped into the spot market to steady the currency. It was last trading at around 7.2834 per dollar, having been as low as 7.2899.

""The rate cut had been coming but it was a bit sooner than expected and the data was significantly weaker than expected,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets. ""Globally, markets are right to be concerned about where China growth is going in the current quarters.""

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) was not far from a one-month low hit on Monday of 506.3 as worry about China's frozen property sector swept across regional markets.

Property investment, sales and fundraising extended their slide in July, data on Tuesday showed. New construction starts by floor area are down nearly 25% year-on-year and highlight how there is neither the appetite nor funds to build.

In Britain, sterling rose and two-year British government bond yields, which are sensitive to speculation about interest rate changes, hit their highest level in a month.

That followed data showing basic wages in Britain hit a new record growth rate, adding to worries for the Bank of England (BoE) about long-term inflation pressures even after 14 back-to-back increases in interest rates.

""We expect another hike in September and another one after that,"" said Scicluna.

China's weak data overshadowed a surprise in Japan, where tourism and car exports sent annualised growth surging to 6% in the second quarter, well above the 3.1% analysts had expected. That lifted the Nikkei (.N225) by 0.6%.

The yen showed little reaction and hit a nine-month low of around 145.86 to the dollar, capped as controlled Japanese yields leave a wide gap on rising U.S. yields.

The euro was up a fifth of a percent at $1.0925.

In Australia, wages growth came in steady for the last quarter, just below expectations, and added to the case for a pause in interest rate hikes for the time being.

Russia's central bank meanwhile hiked its key interest rate by 350 basis points to 12%, an emergency move to try and halt the rouble's recent slide after a public call from the Kremlin for tighter monetary policy.

The rouble pared gains after the decision to stand 0.3% weaker at 98.00, but still significantly above lows near 102 on Monday which had not been hit since the early weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine.

""Today's rate hike will only temporarily slow the bleeding,"" said Liam Peach, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London.

Brent crude futures were 40 cents weaker at $85.81 per barrel.

AMC Entertainment to effect 10:1 reverse split on Aug. 24,"[1/3] The AMC theatre in Burbank, California, U.S., June 30, 2020. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni

Aug 14 (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC.N) said on Monday its 10-to-1 reverse stock split will take place on Aug. 24 and its preferred shares ""APE"" will be converted to common stock on Aug. 25.

The common shares of the theatre chain operator fell 38% to $3.25 in premarket trading, while its preferred shares rose 18% to $2.09.

AMC aims to increase its Class A common stock to 550 million from about 524 million, it said in a regulatory filing.

The company would make a settlement payment of one Class A common stock for every 7.5 Class A shares to the entitled shareholders after the reverse stock split.

The move follows a revised stockholder settlement, which was approved by a Delaware judge last week.

AMC was sued in February for allegedly rigging a shareholder vote that would allow it to convert preferred stock to common stock and issue hundreds of millions of new shares.

LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices stabilised on Tuesday as sluggish Chinese economic figures were countered by Beijing unexpectedly cutting key policy rates for the second time in three months.

Brent crude futures dipped 29 cents to $85.92 per barrel by 0759 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slipped 36 cents to $82.15 a barrel.

Supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, part of the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, had helped galvanise a rally in prices over the past seven weeks.

China's industrial output and retail sales data on Tuesday showed the economy slowed further last month, intensifying pressure on already faltering growth and prompting authorities to cut key policy rates to shore up activity.

""When the oil market appears to be comfortable in rally of late, it is often the case that China is the number one fire douser, throwing a wet blanket over those dreaming for heady ($)90-handle crude and beyond,"" said John Evans of oil broker PVM.

In an effort to shore up support, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) lowered the rate on 401 billion yuan ($55.3 billion) in one-year medium-term lending facility (MLF) loans to some financial institutions by 15 basis points to 2.5%.

""The market was expecting the PBOC to wait until September before easing again, and today's cuts suggest that the authorities' concern about the state of the macroeconomy is mounting,"" said Robert Carnell, Asia Pacific head of research for ING Bank.

On a brighter note, refinery throughput in July at the world's biggest oil importer rose 17.4% from a year earlier, as refiners kept output elevated to meet demand for domestic summer travel and to cash in on high regional profit margins by exporting fuel.

Still, sentiment on China is souring, added PVM's Evans.

""Markets are...becoming bored of the tepid stimulus shown so far from officials who think if they keep talking big and delivering small repeatedly, investors will believe them.""

SAO PAULO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (EMBR3.SA) on Monday shot past market estimates for second-quarter results, with its chief executive voicing optimism about upcoming quarters for the company.

Francisco Gomes Neto said in an interview there is a ""good chance"" Embraer will deliver 80 or more commercial aircraft next year, up from a higher-end forecast of 70 in 2023, and return to a level of 100 or more by 2025, or 2026.

The world's third-largest plane manufacturer - after Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing (BA.N) - last topped 100 deliveries in 2017, before hitting snags in an attempted deal with Boeing and then COVID-19-related hold-ups.

""Despite the supply chain challenges, we are very optimistic about this year after a good Q2,"" Gomes Neto said. ""We expect Q3 to be good as well and an even better Q4, with new deals in the commercial and defense units expected in the second half.""

The Brazilian company had previously disclosed deliveries of 47 aircraft in the quarter, seen as a positive sign by analysts who believe Embraer will meet its target this year of delivering up to 200 jets overall - both commercial and business.

""We're working hard so next year we can better spread out production and deliveries throughout the year, which will further improve the company's performance,"" Gomes Neto added.

He said the company has already signed a deal with an undisclosed client that will increase its backlog by $700 million in the third quarter.

Shares in Embraer rose as much as 5.7% immediately after the earnings report before paring gains in a volatile session. Brazil's benchmark stock index Bovespa (.BVSP) dropped more than 1%.

The planemaker reported a 25% increase in second quarter adjusted net profit to $57.9 million, more than double the $24.3 million forecast by analysts polled by Refinitiv.

Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $148.9 million, up 20% from the previous year and above the market consensus of $116.2 million.

JPMorgan analysts highlighted its EBITDA margin of 11.5%, up 10 percentage points quarter-on-quarter, as particularly strong.

Embraer maintained its outlook for the year, with net revenue forecast to rise by as much as 27% to between $5.2 billion and $5.7 billion.

Embraer's quarterly figures and backlog indicate ""strong results for the year,"" analysts at BTG Pactual said.

Investors least bearish since February 2022 - BofA,"A Bank of America logo is seen on the entrance to a Bank of America financial center in New York City, U.S., July 11, 2023. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo

MILAN, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Sentiment among global investors improved in August to its least bearish since February 2022 with cash allocations falling to a 21-month low, a Bank of America survey showed on Tuesday.

The poll of fund managers with $545 billion of assets found that investors remain of the view that global growth will weaken in the next 12 months but expectations improved significantly.

Three out of four respondents expect a soft landing or no landing in global growth and the proportion of those expecting weaker growth fell markedly to net 45% from 60% in July.

Cash allocations fell to 4.8% from 5.3% last month and the underweight in equities narrowed to the smallest since April 2022. BofA said bearish positioning was a strong tailwind in the first half of 2023 but that was not the case in the second half.

There was capitulation in positioning on REITS to levels last seen during the Global Financial Crisis, as investors rotated into stocks and commodities, according to the poll.

Companies Salesforce Inc Follow

NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Salesforce Inc (CRM.N) was heavily criticized by several activist investors in early 2023 but by the end of June, after results came in better than expected and a new director was added, filings show some cut their stakes or exited completely.

Starboard Value, among the first to publicly push the U.S. software company in October to do better calling for a greater focus on profitability, cut its stake by 20% to own roughly 2 million shares on June 30, according to a regulatory filing.

Third Point LLC, which had owned 800,000 shares earlier this year, no longer owned any shares on June 30, its filing shows.

The changes in ownership came after significant overhauls at Salesforce helped push its share price higher.

Inclusive Capital Management, one of four activists closely involved with Salesforce in early 2023 along with Starboard, Elliott Investment Management and ValueAct Capital, exited even earlier, according to filings.

After Inclusive owned 1.6 million shares at the end of 2022, Salesforce was no longer listed on filings detailing ownership for the first or second quarters.

Pressure built on Salesforce and its CEO Marc Benioff during the first months of 2023. But cost cuts, news that it was boosting its share buybacks and dismantling its mergers and acquisition committee, plus stronger-than-expected fourth quarter growth went a long way to quiet the activists, sources familiar with the matter said.

The company also added Mason Morfit, the co-chief executive officer of investment firm ValueAct, to its board during the first quarter. ValueAct's ownership stake remained unchanged at 3.5 million at the end of the second quarter, its filing shows.

However, a handful of other investors, including ones that might not have been pushing for change, cut their holdings between April and the end of June.

Sachem Head Capital Management cut its stake by 20% after Salesforce made up nearly 5% of its portfolio. Farallon Capital Management sold 44% of its stake in Salesforce during the second quarter, while Polen Capital cut its holding by 24% and Light Street Capital reduced its ownership stake by 15%.

Salesforce's stock price has surged 57% since January and the bulk of the move occurred during the first quarter when the activists were pushing for changes and the company delivered.

During the second quarter the stock price moved to $211 a share from $199 a share. It closed at $212.06 on Monday.
