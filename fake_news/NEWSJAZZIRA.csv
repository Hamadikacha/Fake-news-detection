Haiti’s crisis deepens as thousands displaced by violence,"More than 3,000 people have fled their homes amid growing violence in neighbourhoods of Port-au-Prince, UN agency says.

A surge in violence in parts of Haiti’s capital over the past week has pushed more than 3,000 people to flee their homes, including many who have been forced to seek shelter in improvised sites that leave them vulnerable to attacks.

More than half of the internally displaced people in Port-au-Prince “have had to leave their temporary accommodations in host communities” for the improvised sites where conditions are “extremely dire”, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Wednesday.

The agency estimates that nearly 200,000 people are displaced across the Caribbean nation, with the highest concentration in the capital, where fierce fighting between armed gangs has raged over the past several months and violence has skyrocketed.

“High levels of insecurity are creating a climate of mistrust between certain host communities and displaced populations, thus deteriorating social cohesion,” the IOM said.

“This situation is causing the displaced persons to leave the relative safety of these homes for improvised displacement sites where they are exposed to additional risks, including communal violence, sexual and gender-based violence, discrimination, and outright abuse.”

Earlier this week, an IOM emergency data tracker reported that armed violence in the Port-au-Prince neighbourhoods of Carrefour-Feuilles and Savanes Pistaches at the weekend had forced approximately 3,556 people across 717 households to flee.

Most have taken shelter in local schools, the agency said.

Gang violence has surged in Haiti – particularly after the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise, which created a power vacuum – and the country’s virtually non-existent government system has made stemming attacks more difficult.

The violence has impeded access to healthcare facilities, forced the closure of schools and clinics, and worsened already dire food insecurity by cutting residents of gang-controlled areas off from critical supplies.

Meanwhile, Haiti’s de facto leader, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, whom Moise chose for the post just days before he was killed, has faced a crisis of legitimacy – and attempts to chart a political transition for Haiti have failed.

“The dire security situation is exacerbated by intense political deadlock, a dysfunctional judicial system, and long-running impunity for human rights abuses,” Human Rights Watch said in a report on the crisis earlier this week.

In October of last year, Henry called on the international community to help set up a “specialised armed force” to quell the violence, a demand that has the backing of the United States and the United Nations.





Some Haitian civil society leaders have rejected the prospect of foreign intervention, saying past deployments have brought more harm than good.

But late last month, Kenya said it was prepared to lead a “multinational force” in Haiti – provided the mission gets a mandate from the UN Security Council – to help train and assist the Haitian police to “restore normalcy”.

A Kenyan delegation is expected to travel to Haiti soon to assess a possible mission.

Meanwhile, news outlets reported on Tuesday that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had offered a range of options for Haiti in a report to the Security Council.

“Addressing the security situation in Haiti requires a range of coercive law enforcement measures, including active use of force in targeted police operations against heavily armed gangs,” Guterres said in the 12-page letter, as reported by The Associated Press.

The report came in response to a Security Council resolution adopted on July 14 asking Guterres to come up with “a full range of options” within 30 days to help address the violence in Haiti, the news agency said.",1
Congressman Ro Khanna slammed for meeting Hindutva ideologue on India visit,"Analysts say Khanna’s meeting shows that he doesn’t want to alienate his Hindu Indian diaspora vote bank in the US.

United States Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna has come under sharp criticism for meeting far-right Hindutva ideologue Abhijeet Iyer-Mitra on his recent trip to India, with many pointing out that his embrace of Hindu nationalists is against the progressive values that he has claimed to espouse.

Khanna, who is the co-chair of the Congressional India Caucus, is leading a bipartisan congressional delegation to the country of his parents’ birth, where he has met Indian government officials, and business and technology leaders.

On Monday, Iyer-Mitra posted a photograph with Khanna on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, and said: “Had a very productive breakfast meeting with @RoKhanna. Free & frank exchange of views. I thank the congressman for his candour & his perspicacity, as well as striving to improve India-US relations.”

In response, Khanna wrote: “Great conversation @Iyervval! Appreciated the candid exchange, your insights about the US India relationship, and the back and forth.”

The Indian-American Muslim Council, an advocacy group based in the US, said it was “deeply disappointed to see Khanna engaging with a far-right Islamophobe”, and condemned him for embracing those who “enable [this] cycle of hate and violence” against Muslims.

Since Prime Minister Narendra came to power in 2014, Muslims have faced increasing attacks, including lynchings on mere suspicion of cow smuggling. Many Muslim activists have been thrown into jail for protesting against the government’s anti-Muslim policies.

On August 1, a Hindu mob killed a deputy imam of a mosque in Gurugram city next to the capital, New Delhi, a day after deadly sectarian violence in a neighbouring district in Haryana state. Hundreds of Muslim houses have been demolished by state authorities without following due process in what activists say is a “collective punishment” against the minority community.

A religious freedom watchdog, for the fourth year in a row, in May recommended that the Indian government be added to a blacklist. In its annual report, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) called on the Department of State to designate India as a “country of particular concern” for the worsening conditions of minorities in the South Asian country of 1.4 billion people.

We are deeply disappointed to see @RoKhanna engaging with a far-right Islamophobe who called Khanna's own colleague @Ilhan @IlhanMN a ""terrorist"" & ""Al Qaeda."" Last week, during our meeting, you pledged to stand with the victims. Yet, you've embraced those who enable this cycle… https://t.co/Id03NgtMJ4 — Indian American Muslim Council (@IAMCouncil) August 15, 2023

Iyer-Mitra has been accused of promoting an Islamophobic narrative through his tweets.

Last October, he called Khanna’s Muslim colleague, Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a “jihadi” after her sharp exchange with an Indian journalist during a US House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on “Human Rights in South Asia” in Washington, DC.

As part of the Democratic Party’s Progressive wing, which also includes Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib, among others, Khanna has promised to reject Hindu nationalism.

Wow!!! Jihadi @IlhanMN just levelled a set of slanderous Pakistani talking points at @AartiTikoo & then doesn’t give her the chance to respond turning to Fai’s lil ISI muppet Angana Chatterji. Choreographed misuse of her prerogative. — Abhijit Iyer-Mitra (@Iyervval) October 22, 2019

Iyer-Mitra has also spoken and written on Israel’s occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and has said India has “a lot to learn” from the Israeli use of force and intelligence in the occupied Palestinian territory. He has opposed terming Israel’s occupation as apartheid.

Journalists and academics based in the US and India have criticised Khanna for meeting Iyer-Mitra, calling on the congressman to “apologise” to his Democrat colleague Omar and issue a “forceful statement” against Iyer-Mitra.

Khanna has responded to the criticism by saying he met Iyer-Mitra as he had “sharply criticized my grandfather (see his past posts on me) and we met so I could stand up for my grandfather legacy as a freedom fighter. [India Independence hero Mahatma] Gandhi had a philosophy of engaging with almost anyone – including British colonizers.”

The 46-year-old who represents California’s 17th Congressional District said his “core values have never changed” after meeting people he doesn’t agree with.

I’m often criticized for speaking with people I disagree. But I continue to think we shouldn’t shy away from debates and opportunities to engage people who have different ideologies. My core values have never changed as a result of meeting people. @azadessa @ShabanaMir1… https://t.co/IhXRVokcjU — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) August 16, 2023

‘Appeasing his Indian backers and electorate in US’

Khanna played a key role in calling for Prime Minister Modi to address a joint seating of the US Congress on his July trip to the US capital. He authored a bipartisan letter and said “the way to make progress on human rights is to engage with the Indian PM”.

He has justified his endorsement of Modi saying the Indian prime minister is democratically elected and that he would continue to speak against the human rights violations.

“It’s the duty of every American politician of Hindu faith to stand for pluralism, reject Hindutva, and speak for equal rights for Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhist & Christians. That is the vision of India my grandfather Amarnath Vidyalankar fought for,” he had posted on X four years ago in response to an article on the rise of Hindutva – an ideology that calls for the supremacy of Hindus in India – in the US.

Khanna’s meeting with Iyer-Mitra has been termed an act of appeasement by a US-based academic.

“When he goes and meets with people like Abhijeet [Iye-Mitra] or others who are to the right of Indian Hindutva, he is basically appeasing his Indian backers and electorate in the US,” Mohamad Junaid, an assistant professor at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts in New York, told Al Jazeera.

Junaid said Khanna represents “the broader character of Hindu Indian diaspora in the US, which often votes for democratic candidates but is also highly radicalised by the Hindutva movement in India”.

According to the academic, the congressman is trying to align himself with the liberal wing of the Democratic Party but does not want to alienate the Hindu diaspora, which is a big overseas financier.

“He [Khanna] knows what he is doing – he wants to run with the hare and hunt with the hound.”

Khanna has also been questioned for not meeting Indian opposition leaders or minority representatives during his trip.

The article is paywalled, so I don't really know to what extent Rep Khanna met with Muslim, Christian, Sikh, and Dalit leaders, or with communities affected by the hateful rhetoric of Abhijit Iyer (whom he did meet). — professor mir (@ShabanaMir1) August 15, 2023",1
More than a dozen Niger soldiers killed in attack near Mali border,"The Nigerien Defence Ministry says another 20 soldiers were wounded in the attack.

At least 17 Niger soldiers have been killed in an attack by armed groups near the border with Mali, the country’s Ministry of Defence said.

According to a statement released late on Tuesday, “a detachment of the Nigerien Armed Forces (FAN) moving between Boni and Torodi was the victim of a terrorist ambush near the town of Koutougou [52km southwest of Torodi]”.

It added that another 20 soldiers had been injured, with all of them evacuated to Niamey, the capital.

More than 100 assailants were “neutralised” during their retreat, the army said.

In the last decade, the border area where central Mali, northern Burkina Faso and western Niger converge has become the epicentre of violence by armed groups linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) in the Sahel region.

Anger at the bloodshed has fuelled military takeovers in all three countries since 2020, with Niger the latest to fall to a coup on July 26 when President Mohamed Bazoum was removed.

Southeast Niger is also the target of armed groups crossing from northeastern Nigeria – the cradle of a campaign initiated by Boko Haram in 2010.

The coup leaders had said Bazoum’s ouster was due to the insecurity in the country was “due to the deteriorating security situation and bad governance”.

But Al Jazeera’s Ahmed Idris, reporting from Abuja in nearby Nigeria, said the Nigerien military government’s revoking of agreements with French military and suspension of aid by Niamey’s other partners “makes life more difficult”.

“It will be difficult now for Niger to source for equipment, for weaponry and deal with the rising cases of attacks by these armed groups in the Sahel … it may have to rely on countries like Mali and Burkina Faso for expertise and also from the mercenary groups that have been operating in these two countries,” he said on Wednesday.

“But how much can they give? How long will that be? They too are facing a similar problem,” Idris added.",1
"Mobs burn Christian churches, homes in Pakistan after blasphemy allegations","Hundreds of people armed with batons and sticks attack churches in Jaranwala after the holy Quran was allegedly desecrated.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Armed mobs have attacked at least two churches in Punjab province’s Jaranwala town accusing two Christian residents of blasphemy.

Videos on social media showed hundreds of people armed with batons and sticks attacking the Salvation Army Church and the Saint Paul Catholic Church, setting them ablaze, while another mob attacked private homes, torching them and breaking windows.

Mohammed Naved, a Punjab provincial police inspector, said authorities were doing their best to control the mob in Jaranwala, 115 km (71 miles) from Lahore, the provincial capital.

“We are undertaking all legal measures as required in the situation,” Naved told Al Jazeera.

Police also filed a report against two local Christian residents under Pakistan’s controversial blasphemy laws.

Words fail me as I write this. We, Bishops, Priests and lay people are deeply pained and distressed at the Jaranwala incident in the Faisalabad District in Pakistan. A church building is being burnt as I type this message. Bibles have been desecrated and Christians have been… pic.twitter.com/xruE83NPXL — Bishop Azad Marshall (@BishopAzadM) August 16, 2023

Later on Wednesday, Punjab’s caretaker information minister, Amir Mir, said that more than 100 people were arrested.

Paramilitary Rangers have been deployed “in connection with the religious conflict and sensitive situation of law and order at Tehsil Jaranwala District Faisalabad”, according to an official statement.

The controversy erupted after torn pages of the Quran, the holy book for Muslims, were discovered near the Christian colony with alleged blasphemous content written on them.

The pages were taken to a local religious leader, who reportedly urged Muslims to protest and demand that the culprits be arrested.

Shahid Mehmood, a resident of Jaranwala who owns a mobile shop about 50 metres from the Salvation Army Church, told Al Jazeera, “I reached my shop around 10am, and there were already hundreds of people gathered outside the church. Given the situation, I decided to close 10 minutes after opening.”

Mehmood added that a crowd also gathered around the Christian colony near the church. It was later attacked, and a few smaller churches were damaged, he said.

Akmal Bhatti, chairman of Minorities Alliance Pakistan, condemned the incident and said the angry mob used the blasphemy laws to justify torching the private homes of innocent people.

Bhatti, a lawyer, said more than 150 families resided in the Christian colony near the Salvation Army Church, and as the situation worsened, women and children evacuated.

“As things looked tense, families started leaving Jaranwala to go to their relatives in a nearby village, or the city of Faisalabad, which is roughly 40km [24 miles] away,” he told Al Jazeera from Jaranwala.

Blasphemy is a sensitive issue in Pakistan as mere accusations can lead to widespread violence.

Earlier this month, a teacher was killed in Turbat in the southern province of Balochistan after being accused of blasphemy during a lecture. In February this year, an angry mob snatched a suspect from his prison cell in the rural district of Nankana and lynched him for allegedly desecrating pages of the Quran.

Rights groups say Pakistan’s blasphemy laws have often been used for personal reasons.

Centre for Social Justice, an independent group advocating for the rights of minorities, has compiled data on blasphemy cases in Pakistan, which shows more than 2,000 people have been accused of blasphemy since 1987, and at least 88 people have been killed on these allegations.",1
Dozens feared dead after boat capsizes off Cape Verde,"UN migration agency says 38 refugees and migrants rescued and 63 others believed to have died.

Several people have been found dead and 38 others rescued from a boat off Cape Verde, authorities said as the International Organization for Migration (IOM) warned that dozens more people were missing and feared dead.

More than 60 people are believed to have died when a migrant boat that left Senegal in July capsized off Cape Verde, the IOM said on Wednesday.

Sixty-three people are thought to have died, while the 38 survivors included four children aged 12 to 16, IOM spokesperson Safa Msehli told the AFP news agency.

The fishing boat left Senegal a month ago, according to media reports in Cape Verde, an island nation about 620km (385 miles) off the West African coast.

Senegal’s foreign ministry said late on Tuesday that 38 people, including a citizen of Guinea-Bissau, were rescued from the boat.

The coast guard said the total number of survivors and dead was 48. The local morgue said it had received seven dead bodies.

The vessel was spotted on Monday almost 320km (200 miles) from the island of Sal by a Spanish fishing boat, which alerted Cape Verde authorities, police said.

“We must open our arms and welcome the living and bury the dead with dignity,” said Cape Verdean Health Minister Filomena Goncalves, as quoted by the Inforpress news agency.





The Spanish migration advocacy group Walking Borders said the vessel was a large fishing boat, called a pirogue, which had left Senegal on July 10 with more than 100 refugees and migrants on board.

Families in Fass Boye, a seaside town 145km (90 miles) north of the capital Dakar, had contacted Walking Borders on July 20 after ten days without hearing from loved ones on the boat, group founder Helena Maleno Garzón told the Associated Press news agency.

Cheikh Awa Boye, president of the local fishermen’s association, said two of his nephews were missing. “They wanted to go to Spain,” Boye said.

Jose Rui Moreira, a health official in Sal, said seven survivors needed to be taken to hospital, the AFP news agency reported.

Cape Verde lies on the maritime migration route to the Spanish Canary Islands – a gateway to the European Union.

Thousands of refugees and migrants fleeing poverty and war risk their lives to make the dangerous journey each year.

They often travel in modest boats or motorised canoes supplied by smugglers, who charge a fee for the journey.

In January, rescue teams in Cape Verde saved about 90 refugees and migrants adrift in a canoe, while two others on board died.

They were from Senegal, The Gambia, Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.",1
H&M probes alleged Myanmar factory abuses as pressure intensifies,"H&M, the world’s second-largest fashion retailer, is investigating 20 alleged instances of labour abuse at Myanmar garment factories that supply it, Reuters news agency has reported, just weeks after Zara-owner Inditex, the top fashion retailer, said it was phasing out purchases from the Southeast Asian country.

A British-based human rights advocacy group tracked 156 cases of alleged worker abuse in Myanmar garment factories from February 2022 to February 2023, up from 56 in the previous year, indicating a deterioration of workers’ rights since a military coup in February 2021.

Wage reduction and wage theft were the most frequently reported allegations, followed by unfair dismissal, inhumane work rates, and forced overtime, according to a report by the non-governmental organisation the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC).

“All the cases raised in the report by BHRRC are being followed up and where needed remediated through our local team on the ground and in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders,” H&M said in a statement.

“We are deeply concerned by the latest developments in Myanmar, and we see increased challenges to conduct our operations according to our standards and requirements,” the Swedish retailer said.

The BHRRC has tracked allegations of workers’ rights abuses in Myanmar garment factories since the military government took power, plunging the country into a political and humanitarian crisis. The tracker includes abuse cases at 124 separate factories.

The BHRRC said it tracks cases of alleged abuses through sources including union leaders, international media, and local media such as Myanmar Labour News, and seeks to verify reports by checking with brands and interviewing workers. Reuters has not independently verified its findings.

There have been 21 cases of alleged abuses linked to Inditex suppliers over the two-year period, and 20 linked to H&M suppliers, according to the report. Inditex declined to comment on the report.

Others mentioned in BHRRC’s report include Irish multinational fashion retailer Primark, which has 19 cases of alleged abuse; Denmark-based Bestseller, which owns popular Vero Moda and Jack & Jones brands and has 17 cases of alleged abuse; and Polish clothing company LPP, with 12 cases of alleged abuse.

“We welcome the spotlight organisations such as the BHRRC put on these issues, and we will continue to fully investigate and remediate any allegations we are made aware of, where possible,” Primark told Al Jazeera in an emailed statement.

“This report highlights the stark reality of sourcing from Myanmar in the current environment and the worrying impact on workers’ rights and safety,” it added.

The company has previously said it stopped placing new orders with Myanmar suppliers in October 2022, and expects the last of its orders from the country to ship by the end of 2023.

Al Jazeera has reached out to Bestseller and LPP for a response.

A spokesperson for Myanmar’s military government did not reply to a request for comment from Reuters news agency on the findings. The Myanmar Garment Manufacturing Association did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.





Made in Myanmar

The decision by Inditex to cut ties with Myanmar suppliers came after Primark and Marks & Spencer announced plans to exit last year, in a trend that some say could ultimately leave garment workers worse off.

Spanish fashion retailer Tendam also plans to stop sourcing from Myanmar, it said in its response to a BHRRC survey of brands published alongside the report.

“We do have a plan to leave the country but [it] has not been announced yet,” Tendam wrote, without detailing its reasons. Tendam did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Primark told Reuters that though it expects its final orders from Myanmar suppliers to ship before the end of this year, it has recently increased its presence on the ground.

“As we work towards our exit, we’ve doubled the size of our Ethical Trade team on the ground, enabling us to more regularly visit the factories we still work with and giving us greater visibility,” Primark said in an email on Wednesday.

Some brands continuing to source from Myanmar have also ramped up monitoring of suppliers.

Danish fashion company Bestseller increased the number of staff in its Myanmar office from three to 11 since the coup, it said in its survey response.

H&M, Bestseller, and Tendam are among 18 brands forming part of the European Union-funded MADE project aimed at improving labour conditions in Myanmar’s garment factories.

The EU’s stance is that companies should continue sourcing from Myanmar, where the garment industry is a key employer, with more than 500 factories producing clothes and shoes for big brands.

“By engaging as a company in discussions with local labour rights groups and trade unions on wages and labour conditions, you can have leverage,” said Karina Ufert, CEO at the European Chamber of Commerce in Myanmar. “By leaving the country, it is difficult to see how you can have an influence on local conditions.”

Vicky Bowman, former British ambassador to Myanmar and director of the Myanmar Centre for Responsible Business, said the international brands under pressure to stop buying from Myanmar were also the most likely to provide stable jobs and take additional steps to guard against rights abuses.

“If they leave, either the jobs disappear entirely, or factories scrabble to receive orders from footloose buying agents who care only about cheap labour and do not worry about factory conditions,” Bowman told Reuters.

In the BHRRC survey, some of the world’s biggest apparel brands detailed their approach to the dilemma.

In its response, sportswear giant Adidas wrote: “Despite the human rights and labor rights risks which have been identified, we believe that through enhanced human rights due diligence measures, we can continue to do business in Myanmar in a responsible manner and in alignment with core ILO [International Labour Organization] conventions, the UN Guiding Principles, and the OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] Guidelines.”

Britain’s Next wrote that it had considered withdrawing from Myanmar, but “whilst it can send a clear signal to the local government that its policies and practices are unacceptable, it can do huge damage to local communities and workers, depriving them of desperately needed investment and wages.”",1
‘Traumatic’ trend: Ransom kidnappings thrive in South Africa as crime soars,"Police say kidnappings rose from 3,832 cases in 2013 to nearly 11,000 cases in 2021, with most of those happening in Gauteng.

Johannesburg, South Africa – Last October, what seemed like an ordinary commute to work in Nkangala in the eastern South African province of Mpumalanga, quickly turned into an ordeal for Maggie Skosana and her driver Gugu Mtsweni.

As the car carrying both women approached the Nkangala municipality office which Skosana runs as manager, a car with flashing blue lights, similar to those used by law enforcement agencies in the country, blocked the gate they were to enter through. Three men wearing police-branded balaclavas came out and accosted them.

“They were masquerading as police officers,” Skosana told Al Jazeera. “They indicated they were there to arrest me. I refused and insisted we should go inside the office building. After refusing, one guy came into our car with a rifle and instructed us to drive.”

A short distance away, Skosana, a wheelchair-bound mother of four, was dragged into another vehicle along with her driver and taken to an unknown location. Their car and Skosana’s wheelchair were later found abandoned at a nearby mine by the police.

“They took my bank cards and demanded pin codes, which I gave to them,” says Skosana. In the evening, they were moved to another house in the Gauteng province [138km or 86 miles away] where they were kept for seven days until they were freed. “We were very very scared. We didn’t know where we were, who we were with, and not certain if we will ever see our families again. It was very traumatic for us,” Skosana said, reliving her ordeal.

Media reports at the time suggested that up to 5 million rand ($260,000) was paid to the kidnappers. Skosana declined to confirm to Al Jazeera if any ransom was paid.

Her story is part of an alarming trend of kidnappings on the rise in South Africa. In the last year, there have been a number of brazen abductions captured on mobile phones and security cameras and shared widely on social media. These incidents have caused many individuals, including business owners, to beef up security around them and their families.

Over the past decade, kidnappings have risen nearly 200 percent. According to crime statistics from the South African Police Service (SAPS), the figure ballooned from 3,832 cases in 2013 to nearly 11,000 in 2021. Between January and March 2023, 3,641 cases were recorded, a 10 percent rise compared with the same period in 2022.

Data on the estimates of ransom paid over the last decade is not readily available. But according to a 2022 risk assessment of South Africa, conducted by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime, the figures for kidnapping for ransom and extortion could be much higher than what is reported to the police.

As per the report, many cases are likely under-reported due to “persistent threats to the victim’s well-being and that of his/her family, even after release”.

This increase in kidnappings, experts say, has been largely driven by a surge in transnational organised crime syndicates operating in the country. In neighbouring Mozambique, Asian businessmen and their families have often been targets of similar syndicates for decades.

This has now spilled over to South Africa where armed gangs, some sophisticated and others running small operations, have targeted foreign nationals operating businesses here.

“There are two types of kidnapping syndicates,” anti-crime activist Yusuf Abramjee told Al Jazeera. “The smaller gangs demand anything from 50,000 to 300,000 rand [$2,600-16,000]. And it’s out of greed.”

“The smaller ones are all local,” he added. “Then you have the bigger syndicates with international links. Sometimes the money has to be paid in Bitcoin and in foreign bank accounts and foreign exchanges like in Dubai.”

‘Easy money’

But it is not only the wealthy who are targeted as kidnappers tailor their ransom demands to suit the perceived value of the victims. Some abductees are taken for a couple of hours while the kidnappers clean out their bank accounts, and other victims are kept for longer periods while large ransoms are negotiated.

Nevertheless, the emergence of a wider demographic being targeted by kidnappers is a growing concern to many South Africans and a topic of daily conversation across taxi ranks, bars, and even on radio stations nationwide.

The proliferation of kidnappings across the country prompted the establishment of the Anti-Kidnapping Task Team by the SAPS in November 2021.

The team’s main priority has been to track suspects and syndicates involved in kidnappings around the country. The unit has achieved some success in the two years since its inception, having investigated 134 cases of ransom demands and made 124 arrests.

Currently, the epicentre of the kidnapping crisis is the Gauteng province, the economic heartland of all of Southern Africa and home to Johannesburg, South Africa’s commercial capital. More than half of the total cases so far have been reported from the province. But gangs have been spreading to other parts of the country in search of new targets.

In the port city of Gqeberga in the Eastern Cape province, authorities have reported 183 incidents in the first quarter of this year. Yolisa Mgolodela, provincial spokesperson for the Hawks – an investigative unit of the police, told Al Jazeera that kidnappings have risen as opportunistic criminals are drawn to committing kidnappings because of the perceived low risk. “It’s easy money, you don’t sweat. it’s an easy way of making money for them,” she said.

And that is a hard pill to swallow for survivors like Skosana, whose attackers remain at large.

“Crime is so high in this country,” she lamented. “Thugs are so comfortable they are not even scared of police officers. I feel as South Africans we are on our own when it comes to safety and security.”

A legacy of crime and fear

That criminals see kidnapping as easy money is a reflection of the ease of conducting such operations and of the rampant nature of crime in South African society, one of the world’s most unequal places to live.

Two-thirds of its 21 million youths – who make up almost half of the population – are currently unemployed, a figure worsened by the high cost of living. All of this and thriving corruption in and out of government has created fertile ground for those with limited access to opportunities to seek crime as a means to support themselves.

According to Johannesburg-based think tank the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), kidnappings are inextricably linked to violent crime because almost two-thirds of the incidents are linked to hijackings and business robberies.

After apartheid ended in 1994, the majority of Black people were left without good jobs or access to education and other opportunities. Today’s high crime rates are an enduring legacy of that, analysts say.

While acknowledging the causative factors of crime, Abramjee wants the authorities to crack down on offenders more. “Not enough is being done. They need to beef up the criminal justice system, they need specialised investigators … the courts need to come down hard on the suspects as well, and they must not be given bail for serious charges like kidnapping,” he said.

For kidnapping survivors, not even freedom has liberated them from the lingering trauma of their experience.

Nearly a year after her ordeal, Skosana says she hasn’t fully recovered even though she feels better because of counselling. “I feel very unsafe and I’m paranoid. I don’t trust anyone, especially those around me,” she said.",1
"Extended injury time, no dancing keepers: The Premier League’s new rules","Changes to added time, ‘deliberate’ offside and showing dissent are some of the amendments made to the Premier League rule book.

The English Premier League has returned to action, and it has seemed to pick up from where it left off last season: Reigning champions Manchester City romped to a 3-0 win over Burnley on the opening day.

But all was not the same when it came to the rules with England’s Football Association announcing a string of amendments to how the game would be officiated on the pitch.

Here’s a look at some of these rule changes:

Extra added time

It was at last year’s FIFA World Cup in Qatar that football fans first got a taste of extended injury time.

Referees will be encouraged to add any time spent during prolonged goal celebrations, injury delays and substitutions. Officials will pause the clock when play stops and add that time at the end.

This has not gone down well with some players with Manchester United defender Raphael Varane slamming authorities for ignoring player concerns by increasing the playing time.

We had a meeting last week with the FA. They recommended from the referees new decisions and rules. From the managers and players, we have shared our concerns for many years now that there are too many games, the schedule is overcrowded, and it’s at a dangerous level for… — Raphaël Varane (@raphaelvarane) August 7, 2023

Disciplinary action for time wasting

Goalkeepers and outfield players (taking throws-in or free kicks) will be penalised if officials consider them guilty of employing time-wasting tactics. This could range from a warning to a yellow card.

Offside rule

The most talked-about rule in football just got more confusing.

According to an amendment by the International Football Association Board, “a player who is clearly in an offside position should not become ‘onside’ on all occasions when an opponent moves and touches the ball.”

It further explains a deliberate attempt as when a player has control of the ball with the possibility of passing it to a teammate, gaining possession of the ball or clearing the ball by kicking or heading it, for example.

Goalkeeper’s action during penalties

Argentina’s World Cup-winning goalkepeer Emiliano Martinez will have some trouble adjusting to this rule because goalkpeers may now be disciplined if they attempt to distract the penalty taker in any way.

Technical area

Coaching staff will not be allowed to crowd the technical area, and only one official will be allowed to be present in the dotted box outside the bench.

Dissent

Players surrounding the referee are more likely to be penalised if they run up to them requesting a card or action against their opponents.

Foul threshold

For all the talk of sterner disciplinary action, players could actually face some leniency if it saves time.

Referees could allow play to carry on if they deem a free kick resulting from stoppage in play would waste more time.",1
"Libya fighting leaves 55 dead, dozens injured: Medics","Fighting between rival groups began on Monday night in Tripoli, and ended after the release of a commander on Tuesday.

Tripoli’s worst armed clashes in a year have killed 55 people and wounded 146, Libyan media outlets have reported, as a truce took hold.

Fighting erupted on Monday night and raged through Tuesday between the influential 444 Brigade and the Special Deterrence Force, two of the many armed groups that have vied for power since the overthrow of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

Libya’s Al-Ahrar TV reported the new casualty toll on Wednesday, citing Malek Mersit, spokesman for the Emergency Medical Centre. Medics had previously reported 27 dead and 106 wounded over the two days of fighting in the capital.

In August last year, 32 people were killed and 159 wounded in Tripoli during battles between divided Libya’s two rival administrations that compete for power through shifting alliances with the fighting groups on the ground.

Libya has seen more than a decade of stop-start conflict since the NATO-backed revolt that toppled Gaddafi.

A period of relative stability had led the United Nations to express hope for delayed elections to take place this year, and the latest fighting triggered international calls for calm.

The clashes started after the detention of the head of the 444 Brigade, Colonel Mahmoud Hamza, by the rival Special Deterrence Force on Monday, an interior ministry official said.

Late Tuesday, the social council in the eastern suburb of Souq al-Jumaa, a stronghold of the Special Deterrence Force, announced that an agreement had been reached with Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah, head of the UN-recognised government based in the capital, for Hamza to be handed over to a “neutral party”.

In a televised announcement, the council said a ceasefire would follow the transfer of the force’s commander, and late on Tuesday the fighting abated.

Both armed groups are aligned with Dbeibah’s government.

A total of 234 families were evacuated from front-line areas in the capital’s southern suburbs, along with dozens of doctors and paramedics trapped by the fighting while caring for the wounded, the Emergency Medical Centre said.

Late on Tuesday and into the early hours of Wednesday, Dbeibah visited the southeastern suburb of Ain Zara, which saw some of the heaviest fighting on Tuesday, accompanied by Interior Minister Emad Trabelsi.

Dbeibah “saw for himself the severity of the damage” as he toured the densely populated neighbourhood’s unlit streets, his government’s press office said on its Facebook page.

He gave instructions for a survey of the damage to be carried out so that residents could be compensated, it added.

The interior ministry put in place a security plan to deploy officers to battleground districts to oversee the truce announced between the two sides.





Airport reopens

The Libyan capital’s only civilian airport, Mitiga, which lies in an area under Special Deterrence Force control, reopened to commercial flights on Wednesday, officials said. Flights had been diverted to Misrata, about 180km (112 miles) to the east.

In May, the two armed groups had clashed for hours in Tripoli, also after the arrest of a 444 Brigade member.

The UN mission in Libya said it was “following with concern” the security deterioration in Tripoli and its impact on civilians.

Human Rights Watch Libya researcher Hanan Salah expressed outrage that the capital’s armed groups continued to settle their differences with heavy weaponry in residential areas without being held accountable.

“Surely, Libyans at risk of such violent incidents deserve more? Nothing will change unless there are consequences,” she said.

Libya specialist Jalel Harchaoui said the latest clashes highlighted the failure of the international community to address the problem of the fighting groups.

“However events unfold, the past three years have been wasted by diplomats, politicians, the security planners and peace-building specialists. Tripoli is a territory even more dominated by the militias than before,” Harchaoui said.

The 444 Brigade is affiliated with Libya’s defence ministry and is reputed to be the North African country’s most disciplined. It controls the southern suburbs of Tripoli and other areas.

The Special Deterrence Force, commanded by Abdel Rauf Karah, is a powerful ultra-conservative group that acts as the capital’s police force and controls central and eastern Tripoli, Mitiga air base, the civilian airport and a prison.

Libya is split between Dbeibah’s UN-backed government in the west and another in the east backed by renegade general Khalifa Haftar.",1
Death toll in Dominican Republic explosion rises to 27 as blaze continues,"The cause of the deadly explosion remains unknown, though officials have vowed to pursue accountability in the case.

The death toll from a powerful explosion in the Dominican Republic this week has risen to 27, as firefighters continued efforts to extinguish the ongoing blaze, the country’s national emergency director said.

Juan Manuel Mendez, director of the Emergency Operations Center, also said on Wednesday that there were no longer any people believed missing.

Earlier, authorities cited 10 missing but said that would change as forensic officials identified bodies found by search teams.

Officials said the explosion began on Monday with a fire near a bakery in the city of San Cristobal, which lies just west of the capital of Santo Domingo. The emergency responders have not been able to fully access the building where the explosion occurred.

Anguished friends and family have been pacing outside hospitals and morgues in anger and frustration, saying no one has been providing them with information.

Meanwhile, authorities are probing what might have caused the explosion, vowing to crack down on any business that might not have been following regulations.

Ito Bisono, minister of industry and commerce, told reporters that officials already have determined there were no tanks of any type in the area, adding that he is waiting on authorities to investigate what happened.

“It was of great magnitude,” he said of the explosion.

Bisono spoke inside a cathedral in San Cristobal that held a service Wednesday for those who died, with mourners dressed largely in white filling the building until there was standing room only.

Mendez, of the Emergency Operations Center, said at a news conference late on Tuesday that, if an unidentified factory was operating illegally as some residents have alleged, the investigation would shed light on that.

“If there is some type of culpability or not, the investigation will determine that,” he said. “We will take legal action.”

At least 59 people were injured in the blast, which occurred in a bustling commercial area in the city’s centre and destroyed four buildings and damaged nine others.

More than 30 people remain hospitalised with conditions including fractures, burns and respiratory problems. Two firefighters also were treated for smoke inhalation.

More than 30 ambulances and some 500 personnel including rescuers and officials responded to the incident.

Toxic smoke still hovered over the explosion site, with health officials urging people to wear face masks.

San Cristobal, the birthplace of dictator Rafael Trujillo, was the site of another explosion nearly 23 years ago. An arms depot blew up in October 2000, killing at least two people and injuring more than two dozen others, forcing authorities to evacuate thousands.",1
